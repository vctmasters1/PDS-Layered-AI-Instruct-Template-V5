## Why This Exists

This repository is a **template** that gets imported into many other projects. Once adopted, AI agents will execute commands suggested by these instruction files. If the agent runs `pip install something`, `npm install -g something`, `choco install`, `brew install`, `apt install`, `winget install`, `dotnet tool install -g`, or similar **on the host**, three bad things happen:

1. **Silent host pollution** â€” the developer's machine gains state they did not consent to, often outside any project's lockfile.
2. **Cross-project contamination** â€” a package installed for project A breaks project B that pinned a different version.
3. **Non-reproducible builds** â€” "works on my machine" because the host has state nobody's `package.json`/`requirements.txt`/`CMakeLists.txt` documents.

The fix is not to ban installs. The fix is to make sure **every install lands inside the project's contained environment** (or inside a container/devcontainer the user explicitly chose), and to require explicit confirmation before any host-level mutation.

---

## The Core Rule

**Before any install, build, or tool-bootstrap command, the AI must:**

1. Detect whether the current shell is **inside** a container, devcontainer, VM, WSL distro, virtualenv, or other isolated context â€” **or** running directly on the host.
2. If **inside a contained environment**: proceed normally. Containers are sacrificial; mutating them is the point.
3. If **on the host**:
   - Prefer the project-local containment for the active stack (see [Per-Stack Containment](#per-stack-containment)).
   - If a host-level install is genuinely required, **ask the user first** and explain (a) what will be installed, (b) why it can't be project-local, (c) how to uninstall.
   - Never run `*-install-global`, `*-install -g`, OS package managers, or system-level tool installers without explicit confirmation.

The AI does **not** refuse host installs categorically. It refuses **silent** host installs.

---

## Environment Detection

Run these checks before any host-mutating command. The first positive match means "inside containment â€” proceed":

| Signal | Means |
|---|---|
| `/.dockerenv` exists | Inside a Docker container |
| Env var `REMOTE_CONTAINERS=true` or `CODESPACES=true` | Inside a VS Code devcontainer or GitHub Codespace |
| Env var `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST` is set | Inside a Kubernetes pod |
| `cat /proc/1/cgroup` mentions `docker`, `containerd`, `kubepods`, `lxc` | Containerized Linux |
| Env var `VIRTUAL_ENV` is set | Python venv active |
| Env var `CONDA_PREFIX` is set | Conda environment active |
| Env var `WSL_DISTRO_NAME` is set | Running inside WSL (treated as contained for Linux-tool installs; **still host** for Windows-side installs) |
| `uname -r` ends in `-microsoft-standard-WSL2` | WSL2 distro |
| `$env:CONTAINER` is set (custom convention) | Project marker the user can set |

If none match, the shell is **on the host**.

The [`/ai-env-check`](#ai-env-check) prompt automates this audit and reports findings.

## Per-Stack Containment

For each stack the project uses, prefer the listed containment. The [`/ai-env-check`](#ai-env-check) prompt can scaffold these on request.

### TypeScript / Node

- **Default containment**: project-local `node_modules/` via the project's package manager (`npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `bun`) â€” already isolated per project.
- **Node version**: pin via `.nvmrc` or `package.json` `engines.node`. Use [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [`fnm`](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm), or [`volta`](https://volta.sh/) â€” all install Node into a user-local directory, not the system.
- **CLI tools** (e.g., `tsx`, `vite`, `tsc`): use `npx`, `pnpm dlx`, or add to project `devDependencies` â€” never `npm install -g`.
- **Avoid**: `npm install -g typescript`, `npm install -g <build-tool>` on the host.

### Python

- **Default containment**: per-project virtualenv at `./.venv/` (created by `python -m venv .venv`, or by `uv venv`, `poetry`, `hatch`, `pdm`, `conda`, etc. â€” whatever the project picks).
- **Activation**: always activate before installing. The AI must verify `VIRTUAL_ENV` is set, or use the venv's `bin/python -m pip ...` explicitly.
- **CLI tools** (e.g., `black`, `ruff`, `pytest`): prefer adding to project dependencies; if a tool needs to be globally callable across many projects, prefer [`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io/) (still ask first) over `pip install --user` or `sudo pip`.
- **System Python**: do not modify. Never `sudo pip install` anything. Never `pip install --user` without asking.
- **Avoid**: any `pip install` while `VIRTUAL_ENV` is unset on the host.

### Embedded C / C++

- **Default containment**: out-of-tree build directory (`build/`, `out/`, or per-target subdir). Build artifacts never live alongside source.
- **Toolchain**: prefer project-local toolchains via [`vcpkg`](https://vcpkg.io/) manifest mode, [`conan`](https://conan.io/) in the project, or a pinned toolchain installed by the project's CI/devcontainer â€” not a system-wide cross-compiler the user has to remember to keep updated.
- **System libraries** (e.g., `libssl-dev`, vendor SDKs, JTAG drivers): these usually *do* need host installs. When they do, the AI must (a) ask, (b) document the exact commands in the module's `.dev-docs/`, (c) recommend a devcontainer for new contributors so they don't repeat the manual install.
- **IDE/SDK installers** (Silicon Labs Simplicity, STM32CubeIDE, Segger J-Link, etc.): never auto-install. Always link to the vendor page and ask the user to install manually.
- **Avoid**: `sudo apt install` of build-time dependencies without first asking and documenting.

## Devcontainers & Docker

A **devcontainer** ([`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`](https://containers.dev/)) is the gold standard for this template, because it converts the entire host-vs-container question into "the container is always the right answer." When the project ships a devcontainer:

- VS Code, Codespaces, JetBrains Gateway, and others open the workspace **inside** the container automatically.
- All AI installs land in the container â€” the host stays clean.
- The container definition is part of the repo, so every contributor gets the same toolchain.

**When to recommend scaffolding one** (the AI should suggest, not unilaterally create):

- Project uses **multiple languages or system libraries** (e.g., Node + Python + libpq).
- Project needs **specific tool versions** that differ from typical host installs.
- Project is **embedded** and depends on cross-compilers, JTAG drivers, or vendor SDKs.
- Project has **>2 contributors** and "works on my machine" friction is likely.

**Docker Compose** is the right answer for runtime dependencies (databases, brokers, caches). Never start Postgres/Redis/Kafka directly on the host as a tutorial step â€” provide a `docker-compose.yml` instead.

---

## AI Behavior Rules

When the AI is about to run any command or suggest a setup step, it must:

1. **Detect first.** Run the [Environment Detection](#environment-detection) checks. If detection is ambiguous, run [`/ai-env-check`](#ai-env-check) or ask the user.
2. **Match the matrix.** Cross-reference the operation with [Allowed vs. Restricted Operations](#allowed-vs-restricted-operations). Treat âš ï¸ as a hard stop until the user confirms.
3. **Prefer project-local.** When multiple containment options exist, default to the one closest to the project (project-local > venv/node_modules > devcontainer > host).
4. **Never silently bootstrap.** Do not "helpfully" install a tool the user didn't ask for â€” even if the user's request implies needing it. Surface the dependency and ask.
5. **Document host installs.** If a host install is genuinely required and approved, record it in the relevant module's `.dev-docs/` so future contributors and CI know about it.
6. **Recommend devcontainer when patterns emerge.** If the project has had two or more host-install conversations, suggest scaffolding a devcontainer.
7. **WSL nuance.** Inside a WSL distro, Linux-tool installs are "in containment." Windows-side installs from the WSL shell (rare, but possible via `cmd.exe`/`powershell.exe`) are **host** mutations.
8. **CI gates.** If CI installs system packages, that's the documented escape hatch. The host-isolation rule applies to local developer machines, not to ephemeral CI runners.

## `/ai-env-check`

The [`/ai-env-check`](../.github/prompts/ai-env-check.prompt.md) slash command:

- Runs all [Environment Detection](#environment-detection) checks against the current shell.
- Inspects the workspace for present containment markers (`.venv/`, `node_modules/`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `.devcontainer/`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `.nvmrc`).
- Reports a clear summary: "you are on the host" or "you are inside `<container>`", and which per-stack containment options are present, missing, or recommended.
- **Does not modify anything.** Pure audit. If the user wants to scaffold (a venv, a `.nvmrc`, a devcontainer, a `docker-compose.yml`), the prompt offers to do so step-by-step â€” never automatically.

Run it:

- After cloning, before any other setup work.
- Any time the AI is unsure whether a command will land on the host or in a container.
- During [`/ai-onboard`](../.github/prompts/ai-onboard.prompt.md), which invokes it to pick the isolation strategy for the project.
