# WEB-FwServer: Firmware Storage and OTA Delivery

**Project**: PDS-AutomationSuite-02012026  
**Last Updated**: April 24, 2026  
**Service**: Internal microservice (not directly user-facing)

---

## What This Is

`WEB-FwServer` is a small internal Express microservice. It is the **single source of truth** for firmware binaries and version metadata. It handles upload, versioning, and OTA delivery of firmware to PDS devices.

## Service Rules

| Concern | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Table ownership | `WEB-FwServer` owns `firmwares`. No other service migrates or synchronizes it. |
| User table | Read-only stub. Never write to `users` from this service. |
| Auth | All routes require `verifyToken`. Upload/delete/patch require `adminOnly`. |
| File storage | Binaries in `storage/` — always gitignored. Use `STORAGE_DIR` env var in production. |
| Consumers | Only `WEB-HMI/api` should call this service. It is not directly public-facing. |

---

## Adding a New Device Type

No code changes needed — firmware routes accept any `deviceType` string. Upload a binary via `POST /v1/firmware` with the correct `deviceType` matching the slug registered in `WEB-HMI/api/src/devices/`.

## Firmware URL Path Segments

All four path segments in the download URL come from the DB device row:

```
/v1/firmware/{board}/{hwrev}/{deviceType}/{version}/device-download
```

| Segment | DB column | Provisioned by | Example |
|---------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| `board` | `device.board` | Admin at provision | `esp32c3_sm` |
| `hwrev` | `device.hwrev` | Admin at provision | `hwrev-002` |
| `deviceType` | `device.deviceType` | Admin at provision | `aeroponic-controller` |
| `version` | `device.pendingOtaVersion` | Set when OTA is queued | `C02.0.1.018` |

## Development

```powershell
Set-Location "k:\PDS_AutomationSuite\WEB-FwServer\api"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Service starts on port `3002`. Requires the same PostgreSQL instance as `WEB-Marketplace` and `WEB-HMI`.

---

## Database

- Shared PostgreSQL instance (same as `WEB-Marketplace` and `WEB-HMI`).
- `synchronize: true` in dev; `synchronize: false` + explicit migrations in production.
- **Owns migrations for**: `firmwares` table only.
  - `1741200000000-AddFirmwaresTable` — creates the `firmwares` table
  - `1741400000000-AddFirmwareBoardHwrev` — adds `board` and `hwrev` columns; replaces old 2-tuple unique constraint with 4-tuple `(board, hwrev, deviceType, version)`
- Migrations run automatically via `AppDataSource.runMigrations()` at startup when `NODE_ENV=production`.
- Connection pool: `extra: { max: 5 }` — combined with Marketplace and HMI = 15 total ≤ Railway's ~25 cap.
- `user.ts` entity here is a **read-only stub** — maps to `users` table owned by `WEB-Marketplace`. Do not add migrations for it here.

### Dev startup SQL note

In `src/index.ts`, a `pg` raw-SQL block runs **only in dev** (`NODE_ENV !== "production"`) to add nullable `board`/`hwrev` columns if they are missing (pre-4-tuple era schema upgrade) and to delete rows with NULL key columns before TypeORM synchronize runs. This block does not run in production. In production, only the TypeORM migrations apply.

---

## Deployment

- **Railway**: separate service (`fwserver-service`) from Marketplace and HMI.
- **Internal only**: FwServer is NOT directly public-facing. It has no gateway route. Only `WEB-HMI/api` talks to it server-to-server (via `FW_SERVER_URL` env var — Railway private networking in production).
- **Path prefix**: none (no gateway route). FwServer is reachable only from within the Railway private network.
- `storage/` maps to a Railway volume in production (`STORAGE_DIR` env var).
- CORS: `CORS_ORIGINS` env var should be set to `https://pipedreamsystems.com` (only HMI origin).

**Env vars required at runtime** (Railway dashboard):

| Var | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Shared PostgreSQL connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Must match `WEB-Marketplace` and `WEB-HMI` |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |
| `PORT` | Set automatically by Railway |
| `STORAGE_DIR` | Path to Railway volume mount for firmware binaries |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `https://pipedreamsystems.com` |
